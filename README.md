# Upcycled STIB Validator

## The challenge

The initial challenge was to reuse a decommissioned STIB validator and turn it into something useful.

## Big Picture

Most mornings, when I arrive near the tram stop on my way to work, I have to run (uphill) so I don't miss the tram. 

If I had left home in time, 2 or 3 minutes earlier, I wouldn't have had to run. 

Without having to look at my phone every 2 minutes, I wanted to know when to leave the house to make sure I wouldn't miss the tram or have to run. So the idea was simply to know when the trams would arrive at the stop. 

What could be more elegant than a validator to inform me of the tram's arrival in real time!
